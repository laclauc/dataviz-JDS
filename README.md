# Data Visualization with Python (JDS)

The following notebook serves as an introduction to data visualization with Python training course. 

## Why Data Visualization?
Data visualization (DataViz) is an essential tool for exploring and find insight in the data. Before jumping to complex machine learning or multivariate models, one should always take a first look at the data through simple visualization techniques. Indeed, visualization provides a unique perspective on the dataset that might in some cases allow you to detect potential challenge or specifities in your data that should be taken into account for future and in depth analysis.

## Objectives of the course
The goal of this session is to discover how to make 1D, 2D, 3D and eventually multidimensional data visualization with Python. 

We will explore four different librairies:

* Matplotlib (very similar to Matlab's syntax): classic Python library for data visualization.
* Pandas: its main purpose is to handle data frames. It also provides basic visualization modules.
* Seaborn: it provides a high-level interface to draw statistical graphics.
* Plotly: interactive graphing library

## Configuration and intallation

### Installation with `pip`

If you are managing Python packages (libraries) with `pip`, you can use the configuration file `requirements.txt` to install the specified packages with the specified version.

Open a terminal, go in the directory where the file `requirement.txt` is and execute the following command

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
